i) This is a gallery of images in HIPS format, including single frames,
processed images, and binary and 8-bit animation sequences.  For
information on the format of any image file, type "seeheader <
filename".

ii) The sequence movies/corridor is stored in Left-Right pairs.  The
sequence movies/range is an imaginary walk through a 3D model that has
been generated from the first stereo pair using MSSM (included in
hipsaddon) and expressed in terms of range (brighter pixels are closer
to the imaginary walker).  The sequence movies/intensities is generated
in the same manner as above except that the results are expressed using
the grey-values of the original stereo-pair (those found in
movies/corridor).

iii) The directory 'thermal' contains some pictures (unsurprisingly)
captured with a thermal imager. The image thermal/building.huffed
contains the results of a hough transform (supplied with the HIPSaddon
package) applied to building.s4 The teapot image had some rather hot
tea in it!

iv) The directory turing contains pictures of the late Alan Turing (from
whence the name The Turing Institute comes (and incidentally the people
that supply HIPSaddon)). turing.sobel is the result of turing convolved
with a sobel mask.
 
v) Subdirectory 'kde' contains a number of binary movies which show depth
from motion.  
 
vi) Subdirectory 'textures' includes a couple of artificially generated
textures.

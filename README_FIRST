This is the HIPS image processing software, version 2.  The HIPS software was
completely rewritten in early 1991 to produce this second version.  This file
provides a brief outline of the hips source directories and pointers to the
rest of the HIPS documentation.

TO INSTALL HIPS:

	Follow the instructions in README_INSTALL.

NEW HIPS USERS:

	Print out the manuals, documentation and tutorial as described in
README_INSTALL.  In particular, do a `make man' to print out the manual pages,
and a `make doc' to print out the documentation.

OLD HIPS USERS/PROGRAMMERS/INSTALLERS:

	Look at the description of the changes listed in README_CHANGES and in
the documents described therein.  Note that HIPS-2 is a major revision of HIPS
including changes in installation procedures, new programs, programs which
supercede old programs, changes in program switches, many new capabilities, a
subroutine interface, a large number of changes to the basic low-level
subroutine library including new routines and changes to the arguments to the
old routines.  Locally written HIPS programs will need to be changed, but the
changes are minor (and described in the changes document).  Images created by
the original version of HIPS can be read by HIPS-2.  When written by any
HIPS-2 program, the output image will have the new header format, which
differs from the old header format.  Old HIPS programs will not be able to
read new HIPS-2 image headers.  Users will have to convert these programs to
HIPS-2 (which is a trivial task).  Users of xheader will need to convert
images which included extended headers by hand - the new HIPS-2 software
includes an extended header parameters section which replaces the xheader
package.  Again, consult the changes document.

NEWS FLASH - 5/25/93:  Today a set of major changes to HIPS were installed.
So, if you are a HIPS user who has just received this as an update, you should
be aware of these changes.  Basically, we modified the automatic raster format
conversion software to also handle packed 3-color formats (RGB, RGBZ, and the
newly added ZRGB, BGR, BGRZ and ZBGR).  This impacted lots of programs.  But
the main reason for informing you of this change is that it impacts HIPS
programs you may have written in the past.  If you have any locally developed
HIPS programs which use the automatic conversion software (i.e. that call
fset_conversion, fread_imagec and write_imagec), then you should reread the
documentation on those routines (type `man conversion' after installing the
software).  In particular, it is important that in your programs you get the
values of num_frame and numcolor from the `process header' rather than the
`input header', because these numbers can differ when your program
automatically converts from, for example, RGB to byte.

This directory contains the basic user's and programmer's documentation on
HIPS (other than the Unix-style manual pages which are  found in the
various subdirectories man/ and libman together with source code).
The files are:

hips2changes.me		A list of changes from HIPS-1 to HIPS-2
hips_programmer.me	The programmer's manual
hips_user.me		The command-level user's manual
hips_intro.me		An introductory guide for the novice user
plot3d.me		A manual for the Plot3D package
cat_commands_ref.me	A categorised reference of all of the HIPS commands
			and their arguments
commands_ref.me		A quick reference of all HIPS commands with their
			arguments
cat_commands_list.me	A categorized list of HIPS commands and what they do
subroutine_ref.me	A list of HIPS high-level library functions
			and their call arguments
cat_subroutine_list.me	A categorised list of HIPS high-level library
			functions and what they do
functions_list.me	The low-level library functions and their arguments

All of the files in this directory use the -me macro package.  For example, to
print hips_intro.me on a LaserWriter, type:

	psroff -me hips_intro.me

The files hips_programmer and hips_user.me also require tbl, for example:

	tbl hips_user.me | psroff -me

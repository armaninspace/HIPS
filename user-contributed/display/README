Wframe is an image display routine that can be used to extract a rectangular
portion of an image.  This should be executed from inside a gfxtool.

Input is specified by a file name on the command line, or standard input.
Compressed files are accepted. [both filename and filename.Z are allowed if
the file is compressed.]

The image will be reduced to fit in the window used.  A menu is displayed in
the text portion of the gfxtool.

The menu interaction with the mouse keys is given below.

	menu 1:	L - give pixel value
		M - specify a box corner -> menu2
		R - quit
	menu 2:	L, M, R - second box corner -> menu3
	menu 3:	L - quit
		M - create a new box -> menu1
		R - extract image from outlined box to filename.extract
	then quit

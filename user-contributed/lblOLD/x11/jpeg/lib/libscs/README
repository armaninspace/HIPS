libccs.a and libscs#.a \- conversion libarary for following type of images:

	HIPS, FITS, GIF, ICC, RLE, PNM, SUN-RASTER, AND TIFF

The -lscs# is the conversion library initial routine. This makes your program
	as small as possible when linked with libccs.a (-libccs).
The -lscs1 (libscs1.a) reads only HIPS and FITS images.
The -lscs2 (libscs2.a) can read one more type - RLE image.
The -lscs3 (libscs3.a) reads all of the supporing type images, except
	PICT & JPEG.
The -lscs4 (libscs4.a) reads all of the above types except JPEG.
he -lscs[1-4] only output HIPS and RLE images. For other output formats,
	see "man toany".
The -lscs5 (libscs5.a) reads all.
The -lscs6 (libscs6.a) reads all and writes some of the supporing types:
	HIPS, RLE, and Sun-Raster image.
It will be able to write all above types, or this ability will be implemented
in the future.

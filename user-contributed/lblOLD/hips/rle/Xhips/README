These programs are to convert between HIPS for rle formats. RLE is
the format of the Utah Raster Toolkit (URT), and is available from
cs.utah.edu (128.110.4.21) in the file pub/urt-3.0.tar.Z

These program require the rle library, which is part of this package.

There are some very useful color handling programs in the URT, and a
very nice X-windows image display program, called getx11. A script 
which converts HIPS images to RLE images and calls getx11 is
included here, called Xhips.

hview: an X-windows image display program for HIPS2 images.

usage: hview image  or
       hview < image

The program is meant to be used as a model for using the colormap code
included, rather than to be a really useful image display program.

NOTES:

BUG: contrast slider doesnt work in 'perfect' mode. (probaly a simple bug,
I just havent had a change to fix it yet)

See color.c for brief decription of the arguements for build_colormap()

Send bug fixes, etc, to bltierney@lbl.gov

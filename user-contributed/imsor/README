This directory contains contributions from 

The Institute of Mathematical Modelling (IMM, former IMSOR)    
    The Technical University of Denmark, Building 321
               DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark

The programs have been compiled and used under HP-UX (Hewlett Packard UNIX) 
and they have to a large extent been ported to SunOS and AIX systems.

The latest version of the IMM contribution, hipscontrib.tar.Z, can be 
obtained through anonymous ftp from snake1.imsor.dth.dk (129.142.68.53) 
in pub/unix/jmc.

To get a list of the IMM HIPS programs in public domain just look at
the hips_imm manual page.

Maintenance of the IMM HIPS contribution:

Suggestions and bug reports are welcome!

PS.
In the ....imsor/man directory there is a
shell script called mk_sysV.man. This shell script renames the extension
of the man-files to be .1 instead of .n and at the same time the 
header of the man-files is changed to include the word 1hips. This
makes it easier to recognize the hips commands when you do a keyword
search on the man-pages. The shell script takes two arguments
<fromdir> and <todir> which - in principle - could be the same. <Fromdir>
is the directory where the man-pages are stored now and <todir> is the
new directory.

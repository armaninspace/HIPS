These directories contain various programs developed at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory for use with HIPS2.	This is a extracted version that must be
used with CCS package </pub/ccs/ccs-x.y-tar.gz>.


The following is the README from the HIPS-1 version of the directory, which
briefly describes only a fraction of the programs available in this directory:

Description of some of the contents of this directory:

  README:  this file

  doc/dna_segmentation.me  : copy of a paper which describes the use of
                     some of these programs

subdirectories:

lib/    : directory containing routines for allocating, reading, writing,
          and freeing dynamically allocated 2D and 3D arrays. Used by
          bclean.c, bthin.c, fill_holes.c, flip_quad.c, getobj.c, and hstat.c

doc/    : the above-mentioned paper

hips/	: standard HIPS filters, subroutines and man pages

include/: include files required for these filters (these are not installed
	but simply used in place)

xhips2/	: the routine xhips2 which is a raw X11 viewer (an improvement on
		drivers/xhips)

xwindows/: several XView-based image analysis programs

Some of the new HIPS filters:

	addmask - combines a HIPS image with a binary mask to create a new
		image.

	applylut - apply a text gray-level look-up table to a byte or short 
		formatted HIPS image.

	autocollage - collages a sequence of hips images into a single 
		frame with 50 pixels between each image.

	autoextract - generate a csh script file to automatically extract
		smaller images from a larger HIPS image.

	bdwindow - window on pixels in depth

	bin_mask - apply a bitmask to each pixel of an image

	clip - limit the upper and lower grey values of an images to a
		specified value

	fill_holes - fill small holes in binary HIPS images.

	flip_quad - flips the 4 quadrants of a HIPS image.

	getobj - Selects objects out of an image, and sets the
		rest of the image to a given background value. 

	gray_wedge - generate a gray value ramp image

	hfant - perform simple spatial transforms on a hips sequence of images

	hfant_sh - perform simple spatial transforms on a hips sequence of
		images

	hstat - computes statistics on objects in a HIPS image defined 
		by a binary mask.

	make_mask - create an edge detector mask

	maxseq - overlays two sequences.

	printxyz - makes list of x,y,z locations of objects in a binary image
		mask.

	scale_gray - do window based mapping and quadratic scaling of the
		pixel values of a sequence of images

Similar to previous HIPS filters

   bthin.c  : similar to thin, but uses a different algorithm, is MUCH
              faster, and has some possibly annoying artifacts ( see the
	      man page )

New versions of previous HIPS filters

   bclean2.c   : about 500 times faster than old version, but uses 3-4 times
                more memory
   checkers2 : generate a checker board pattern of gray values
   disphist_short : display histogram files as a bar graph (smaller output
		images)
   ftocc : converts floating images to complex (i and r equal to float
		image)
   histoeq2.c  : now handles short and int images, plus fixes a bug in the
                old version when using the -z option on a sequence
   mls_short : suppress random noise in an image
   suntohips2.c : now looks and sun raster colormap and converts colors
                 to grayscale.

getobj3d/	source code for getobj3d program
	getobj3d - is a 3D version of getobj, 
		which selects objects out of an image, and sets the
		rest of the image to a given background value.

mahe/		source code for mahe program
	mahe - "clipped" adaptive histogram equalization

scale_geom/	source code for scale_geom
	scale_geom - filtered image scale and translate

segal/		source code for segal 
	segal - An X-windows based image/mask viewer, editor, and analyser.

tiff/		source code for tifftoh and htotiff
	htotiff - reads a HIPS file and convert it to TIFF format
	tifftoh - convert a tiff image file to a hips image file

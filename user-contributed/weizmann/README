This directory includes a series of device drivers for an ITI IP-512 series
of boards attached to a Sun.  It was developed at the Weizmann Institute in
Israel by Leah Mory Rauch (leah@wisdom.weizmann.ac.il or
leah%wisdom.weizmann.ac.il@cunyvm.cuny.edu).

They use this software on a Sun with two ITI board-sets: /dev/ipfb1 has an
AP-512 and one FB-512. /dev/ipfb0 has an ALU, HP, AP, and 3 FB's; 2 FB's are
connected to make a 16-bit frame buffer.  To install the system device driver,
they added the following lines to the configuration file:

device          ipfb0 at mbio ? csr 0x1000 priority 3 # imaging ip512
device          ipfb1 at mbio ? csr 0x2000 priority 3 # imaging ip512

This assumes that you are familiar with the way Sun handles drivers and with
the IP-512 line.

This directory contains all files which handle the IP-512 family.
ipfb.c is the device driver; it includes ipfbreg.h which should be copied
to /usr/include/sundev.  They installed it on a Sun-2.
If used, they need to be copied into /usr/sys/sundev, etc., and made part of
the system as described in SUN's documentation.
The rest of the filters should be compiled as the makefile suggests.  You will
need to edit the makefile to reflect your local configuration (e.g., where you
stow the binaries).

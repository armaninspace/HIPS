The program in this directory was donated by Patrick Flynn, a graduate student
at Michigan State University.  It is an extension of the program `catframes'
which allows the user to keep image files in compressed format (using the UNIX
`compress' command).  It automatically uncompresses any files with an
extension of `Z', which is the extension given to files by `compress'.  The
program is compiled as follows:

	cc -o zcatframes zcatframes.c -lhips
	
and is used in the same manner as catframes (you might consider simply
installing it as `catframes'.  The following are the notes on the program from
Pat Flynn (flynn@pixel.cps.msu.edu).

____________________________________________________________________________

I recently had the need to use a catframes-like program where the
input files are compressed by the UNIX compress utility.  Rather than
roll my own, I decided to modify catframes in an upwardly-compatible
manner.  I am appending the source code for the modified version.

I made the following modifications to `catframes.c` to get it working.

1. I have a little 'myfopen' routine which looks at a filename, and
   if it ends with ".Z", opens a pipe to a zcat process, which we can read
   the uncompressed image from.  If the name doesn't end with a .Z, it
   opens the normal file for reading.

2. a 'myfclose' routine closes the file or pipe, as appropriate.  The global
   variable 'pipemode' is used to decide whether the current file is a
   pipe or not.

3. read(2)'s on pipes can return prematurely, without having read all of the
   zcat's output.  I changed the read calls to fread(), using the file
   pointer returned by myfopen.

It works identically to catframes and might be a useful
program to have, especially when disk space is limited and you don't
mind the performance hit of the extra zcat processes.

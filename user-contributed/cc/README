These are various HIPS filters written by Charlie Chubb at NYU (now at
Rutgers).  The manual
pages are in `man' and can be copied to /usr/man/mann.  The sources are in
`source' and can be compiled in the usual way, e.g.:

	cc -o updown updown.c -lhips -lm
	install -s updown /usr/hips

Enjoy.

Some brief descriptions:

updown independently flips the signs of the pixels of seq from stdin.

hupdown flips the signs of pixels, but is constrained to flip exactly
eight in each successive 4 by 4 box.

rflipix generates a sequence of spatially white noise whose pixels
reverse contrast from frame to frame with probability depending
on the pixel values of a sequence read from stdin.

normalize scales an input sequence so that output sequence has a
specified root mean square.

shiftmin adds a constant to a sequence to make its minimum
equal to some specified value.

revalue changes all occurrences of a specified set of values in
a sequence to new specified values.

scaleseq scales a sequence, first searching through the entire
sequence to get max and min values.

isobp applies a spatially isotropic filter to a (ffted) sequence.
User specifies center freq and standard deviation of band.

idealbp applies an ideal filter to a (ffted) seq.  The filter is
a user psecified slice of an anulus in freq space.

getmean, getmin and getmax are for use in shell scripts.  They
write mean, max and min of a sequence directly to stdout.

tex makes it easy to create perceptually distinct micropatterns with identical
autocorrelation functions.

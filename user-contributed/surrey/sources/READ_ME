HIPS functions for image processing of stored files
===================================================
These functions are additions to the HIPS system 
 
./hips_src 
disp_line.c dual_thresh.c gen_poly_frame.c polyfit_line.c histo_line.c 
averages.c pick_line.c meanie.c

Description
===========
Having  the HIPS library installed as described in the release notes, these
files are ready to be compiled and run.
Modify the definitions of TOP, HOME and BIN in the Makefile to suit your file
system. Alter HOME to reflect the directory the source files reside in, and 
HIPSLIB to indicate where ./libhipl.a resides.

Additional Note 
===============
averages  average batches of frames   
pick_line pick a line from an image
histo_line compute grey-level histograms for a line of data
disp_line display grey-level histogram for a single line    
polyfit_line compute a polynomial curve to fit a set of data points
gen_poly_frame generate a frame from a line of data
dual_thresh  two level threshold function
meanie  low pass mean filter for noise reduction

General Functions for operating Datacube Maxvideo Hardware
==========================================================
These functions are designed to operate Datacube MaxVideo hardware from a  
Sun3 host computer, running UNIX BSD V.4.2. MaxWare software drivers are used
for the Datacube products as supplied with the hardware. Functions for both Versions 2.1 and 3.0 MaxWare are explained below.  
               Connections shoould be as follows	     			    
               DIGI             ROI                                       
               P3       ->      P3                                        
     CAMERA -> P12                                                        
     TV     <- P13                                                        
               P7       <-      P7                                        
                        ->      P9                                        
               P10      ->      P10                                       

MaxWare v.3.0
-------------
./max_src_V3 /* Functions operating DIGIMAX DG and ROISTORE RS */
rsGrab.c rsGrab512.c rsAquire.c rsClear.c       

Description
===========
Having followed the Datacube MaxWare V.3.0 installation proceedure as laid down in the documentation supplied, and already having the HIPS library installed as
described in the release notes, these files are ready to be compiled and run.
Modify the definitions of TOP, HOME and BIN in the Makefile to suit your file
system: ie. if MaxWare lib files reside at /mnt/temp/fred/maxvideo/lib then 
alter TOP to reflect this;  TOP = /mnt/temp/fred/maxvideo.
Alter HOME to reflect the directory the source files reside in, and HIPSLIB to
indicate where ./libhipl.a resides.

Additional Note 
===============
rsAquire  acquire an active 512x512 frame in LS of ROISTORE   
rsGrab    grab an full image into ROISTORE LS from the DIGIMAX
rsClear   clear the ROISTORE with a set value  

rsGrab512 grab a 512x512 frame in LS of ROISTORE

Functions to interface Datacube Software and HIPS
=================================================
These functions allow frames to be read from Datacube products and be stored as HIPS files, and HIPS files to be written to Datacube products for display.
              Connections should be as follows	     			    
               DIGI             FRM                                       
               P3       ->      P3                                        
     CAMERA -> P12                                                        
     TV     <- P13                                                        
               P7       <-      P7                                        
               P10      ->      P10                                       

MaxWare v.2.1
-------------
./max_hips_src /* Functions interfacing DIGIMAX and FRAMESTORE to HIPS */
max_rframe.c max_wframe.c 
 

Description
===========
Having followed the Datacube MaxWare V.2.1 installation proceedure as laid down in the documentation supplied, and already having the HIPS library installed as
described in the release notes, these files are ready to be compiled and run.
Modify the definitions of TOP, HOME and BIN in the Makefile to suit your file
system: ie. if MaxWare lib files reside at /mnt/temp/fred/maxvideo/lib then 
alter TOP to reflect this;  TOP = /mnt/temp/fred/maxvideo.
Alter HOME to reflect the directory the source files reside in, and HIPSLIB to
indicate where ./libhipl.a resides.

Additional Note 
===============
max_rframe.cnew  max_wframe.cnew ; are quick versions of the above. Use them if your version of MaxWare is OK.

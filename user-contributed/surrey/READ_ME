The software in this directory includes tools for digitization and display of
HIPS images using Datacube MaxVideo hardware, and a few general HIPS filters.

I have been able to get the V3 Datacube software to work on a Datacube system
in the United States.  This required a certain amount of tailoring of the code
which may be relevant for your own installation.  Here are the things I needed
to do to get the code to work:

	1)  The code is filled with declarations of the form
			int RS_T50 = 0;
	since RS_T50 is a predefined constant, the compiler didn't like these
	and so I have commented them all out.

	2)  The system I was using was 512x512, 60Hz, and had something other
	than the default address space for the device registers.  So, I needed
	to change RS_T50 to RS_T60 throughout, change RS_M2048 to RS_M512
	throughout, and replace RS_MBASE and RS_RBASE with the appropriate
	constants.

	3)  His HIPS code neglected to define Progname, which I have fixed.

	4)  His call to BitBlt left off the final argument, which I have
	inserted as `512'.

	5)  His diagram for the wiring didn't quite work.  When we connected
	DIGI board P7 to ROI board P6, then things became visible on the
	monitor.

Good luck,

Mike Landy

General Functions for operating Datacube Maxvideo Hardware
==========================================================
These functions are designed to operate Datacube MaxVideo hardware from a  
Sun3 host computer, running UNIX BSD V.4.2. MaxWare software drivers are used
for the Datacube products as supplied with the hardware. Functions for both Versions 2.1 and 3.0 MaxWare are explained below.  

MaxWare v.2.1
-------------
./max_src /* Functions operating DIGIMAX DG and FRAMESTORE FS */
fsMenu.c  max_grab.c max_clear.c dgMenu.c windows/

MaxWare v.3.0
-------------
./max_src_V3 /* Functions operating DIGIMAX DG and ROISTORE RS */
rsGrab.c rsGrab512.c rsAquire.c rsClear.c       

Functions to interface Datacube Software and HIPS
=================================================
These functions allow frames to be read from Datacube products and be stored as HIPS files, and HIPS files to be written to Datacube products for display.

MaxWare v.2.1
-------------
./max_hips_src /* Functions interfacing DIGIMAX and FRAMESTORE to HIPS */
max_rframe.c max_wframe.c 
 
MaxWare v.3.0
-------------
./max_hips_srcV3 /* Functions interfacing DIGIMAX and ROISTORE to HIPS */
max_Rroi.c max_Wroi.c

HIPS functions for image processing of stored files
===================================================
These functions are additions to the HIPS system 
 
./hips_src 
disp_line.c gen_poly_frame.c polyfit_line.c histo_line.c 
averages.c pick_line.c dual_thresh.c meanie.c

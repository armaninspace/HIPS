General Functions for operating Datacube Maxvideo Hardware
==========================================================
These functions are designed to operate Datacube MaxVideo hardware from a  
Sun3 host computer, running UNIX BSD V.4.2. MaxWare software drivers are used
for the Datacube products as supplied with the hardware. Functions for both Versions 2.1 and 3.0 MaxWare are explained below.  
              Connections should be as follows	     			    
               DIGI             FRM                                       
               P3       ->      P3                                        
     CAMERA -> P12                                                        
     TV     <- P13                                                        
               P7       <-      P7                                        
               P10      ->      P10                                       
                                                            		    

MaxWare v.2.1
-------------
./max_src /* Functions operating DIGIMAX DG and FRAMESTORE FS */
 menu_demo.c fsMenu.c  max_grab.c max_clear.c dgMenu.c windows/

Description
===========
Having followed the Datacube MaxWare V.2.1 installation proceedure as laid down in the documentation supplied, and already having the HIPS library installed as
described in the release notes, these files are ready to be compiled and run.
Modify the definitions of TOP, HOME and BIN in the Makefile to suit your file
system: ie. if MaxWare lib files reside at /mnt/temp/fred/maxvideo/lib then 
alter TOP to reflect this;  TOP = /mnt/temp/fred/maxvideo.
Alter HOME to reflect the directory the source files reside in, and HIPSLIB to
indicate where ./libhipl.a resides.

Additional Note 
===============
windows directory contains an incomplete version of a window tool for Sunwindows
A greyscale Monitor is required for success. If you have one see if you can makeit go.
menu_demo  uses the Digimax and Framestore main application module 
           using fsMenu.c dgMenu.c functions

max_grab   grab a  frame onto the Datacube Framestore FS0
max_clear  clear  Datacube Framestore

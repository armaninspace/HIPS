This directory contains a HIPS image viewer for the macII.  This 
improved version allows expansion of various portions of
the images, or reading off of pixel values and x,y coordinates off of
the screen.  This directory contains
the binhex4.0 source for the macII application, and 
the lightspeed C sources needed
to build the application, which are the following:

	Coordinates.c
	data.c
	displayops4.c
	main.c
	menu.c
	MacTraps (LSC)
--------------------------
	stdio
	storage
	strings
	unix
---------------------------
	halloc.c (HIPS)
	read_header.c (HIPS)

8/23/91 - Michael Landy:  I've just updated this for HIPS-2 as best I could,
but have no idea whether my edits will work.  G'luck.

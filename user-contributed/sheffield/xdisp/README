xdisp is an X windows HIPS image display tool developed at Sheffield University,
England, and donated to the user-contributed section of HIPS2. It features:

	- resizable viewing window
	- multiple frames
	- choice of LUTs (including user defined)
	- choice of cursor (including user defined)
	- gamma control
	- multiframe overlays in RGB/CMY colors
	- pan and zoom
	- X windows network working
	- polygonal region definition (and naming)
	- elementary statistics on polygonal areas
	- handles most HIPS2 data types directly
	- histogram/cdf display

Hardware required: at least 8-bit color graphics workstation with
OpenWindows system (include and library files). 24-bit color is OK, but
the program will only run in 8-bit mode. Once built, it will run with a
Motif window manager, as long as the OpenWindows and Xt libraries are
available.

Software required: OpenWindows, HIPS2 (include files + hips and hipsh
libraries), cc or gcc compiler. The software has only been built on
SunOS 4.1.x as yet - not ported to Solaris 2 (although it will run under
Solaris 2 binary compatibility). A binary built under SunOS 4.1.3 is
included in ./src for those who've taken the plunge to Solaris 2, and have
binary compatibility.

Intended enhancements are:

        - upgrade to work in 24-bit color mode
        - improved statistics
        - extension of polygons to more general geometry (eg vectors, grids)
        - port to Motif
        - port to Solaris 2

This software was developed by us and for us, and this is its first exposure
to the outside world, so please don't be too harsh in your judgement! It was
developed to extract and analyse fields in multitemporal and multifrequency
airborne/satellite pictures of the Earth, so expect it to be biased towards
that application.

Thanks for trying our software.

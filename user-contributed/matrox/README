This directory includes HIPS support for the Matrox VIP-1024 frame boards.  It
was written at UCLA, and requires a device driver written at Carnegie-Mellon.
The README files in sys/device-driver describe how to get a copy of the device
driver.  This software was provided by Edmond Mesrobian at the UCLA Machine
Perception lab (edmond@cs.ucla.edu).

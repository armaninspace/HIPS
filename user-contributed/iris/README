This directory contains a simple display tool for the IRIS.  You
should specify -I/usr/include/bsd when compiling, and -lbsd when linking.
The following line should do all that is needed:

	cc -Zg -I/usr/include/bsd -o wframe wframe.c -lbsd -lhips.

The -Zg switch is shorthand for including all of the IRIS graphic libraries.

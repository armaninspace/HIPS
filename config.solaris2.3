# Sun 4 configuration file for Solaris 2.3.
# The file "makefile.hdr" contains code common to all makefiles.  It
# should not be necessary to edit that file.

# This file was used to install HIPS on a system running Solaris 2.3 with
# default partitioning scheme and file layout. HIPS binaries go in
# /export/home/hips as this is on the largest partition in the default
# partition layout. Note that sunview is not in Sol 2.3.

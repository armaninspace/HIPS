This directory (hips2/pub) contains source code and documentation which,
unlike the rest of hips2, is considered to be public domain software.
Included here is a library for reading and writing hips image headers (both
HIPS-1 and HIPS-2, both read and write).  These routines do not implement the
entire set of functionality of the standard HIPS-2 routines, but simply
enough to be able to read and write standard raster image sequences.  Thus,
the only HIPS header variables which are handled reasonably completely are
the pixel format (only the raster formats), number of rows and columns
(actually, orows/ocols) and the number of frames.  We hereby give permission
for anyone to make any use of the code in these subdirectories whatsoever,
including copying the code, including it with freely distributed software,
including it with commercially available software, and including it in
ftp-able code.  This permission applies to the following files:

README			README_INSTALL			makefile.src
include/hipspub.h	include/makefile.src		libman/hipspub.n
libman/makefile.src	libsrc/hpub_perr.c		libsrc/hpub_rdhdr.c
libsrc/hpub_wrthdr.c	libsrc/makefile.src		libsrc/makefile.unix
man/hipstoportable.n	man/makefile.src		man/portabletohips.n
sources/hipstoportable.c sources/makefile.src		sources/makefile.unix
sources/portabletohips.c

We do not assert that this software is completely bug-free (although we hope
it is), and we do not support the software (officially) in any way.  The
intention is to make it possible for people to read and write standard HIPS
formatted image sequences, and write conversion programs to other formats,
without owning a license for HIPS-proper.  However, we do require that all
distributed copies of these source files include the following copyright
notice.

Note, if you are interested in using the CEDAR image database, there
is a public domain package for reading the HIPS images into MATLAB
by Patrick Hew (grab

and follow the instructions within).

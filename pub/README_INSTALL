There are two ways to install the software in this directory.  The easiest is
as part of a standard HIPS installation, in which case the software is
installed automatically (via the usual makefile.src files, when the installer
types config configfile; make).  However, if you have acquired these routines
separately from the rest of HIPS, the procedure is as follows:

(1)  Log in as root, if necessary for what follows.

(2)  In directory include, copy hipspub.h to your standard include directory:

	cp hipspub.h /usr/include

(3)  In directory libsrc, configure the file makefile.unix as necessary,
ensure that the intended destination directory (LIBDIR) exists (that is, make
it if necessary), then type:

	make -f makefile.unix install

(4)  In directory libman, print the manual page and copy it to a relevant
manual page directory where it will be found by the man command, for example:

	ptroff -man hipspub.n
	cp hipspub.n /usr/man/manl/hipspub.l

(5)  In directory man, print the manual pages and copy them to a relevant
manual page directory where it will be found by the man command, for example:

	ptroff -man *.n
	cp hipstoportable.n /usr/man/manl/hipstoportable.l
	cp portabletohips.n /usr/man/manl/portabletohips.l

(6)  In directory sources, configure the file makefile.unix as necessary,
ensure that the intended destination directory (DESTDIR) exists (that is, make
it if necessary), then type:

	make -f makefile.unix install

This directory has a previewer for HIPS images for Suns running Xwindows.
It is a hacked version of one of the unsupported demos that came with X to
do the displaying.  It operates similarly to the `sunv' viewer
with the following exceptions:

1. You can't replicate image pixels to make the window bigger.  It shouldn't
   be hard to add this, but this feature is rarely used (?).

2. When you iconify this `tool', the image is still displayed inside the
   icon (neat!)  (That was from the original demo).

This program has only been tested on Suns, but given the portability push
for X, it should run without much modification on any X platform.

Good luck with it

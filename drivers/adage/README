The Adage doesn't allow the user in BYTE mode to write any byte but the
low order one.  Thus, for byte movies, there is a problem in LORES for systems
with more than one memory board, since all boards can't be
written without affecting the others or doing some complicated nonsense
involving masked writes and moving bytes around.  The
files bpsmovie.1board and bps_viewport.1board will work with systems with one
DR256 board.  In April, 1986, we acquired three more boards, and discontinued
work on these programs, switching to bps*.4board.  These programs use the
Adage always in HIRES mode, the 4 boards supplying the 8 bits of each pixel,
or 8 separate planes of binary images.

The routine vaximgld is strictly for downloading image sequences - it does
nothing to cause the images to be displayed.  We use it for pre-downloading
images before running experiments where the MPC or BPS controls image display
of previously downloaded images.  In this routine it is possible to download
images separately to each of four boards in lores mode (by replicating bytes
and using the mask registers).

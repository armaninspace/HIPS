This directory includes various device drivers which may be installed
automatically (see ../README_INSTALL). The Adage and Grinnell directories
will require much human intervention.  Several of the entries are symbolic
links to other parts of the hips directory hierarchy (because ctool is sold
separately, and crs is a part of hipsaddon, and others are user-contributed,
etc.), but that should be otherwise transparent to the installation.

This directory contains a general image analysis tool for viewing and making
measurements upon HIPS images on a Sun console under SunView.  It was written
by Walt Kropfl, and converted for use with HIPS images by Michael Landy.
Hopefully, we will eventually convert it for use under X (e.g., XView) as
well.  The two manual pages in this directory should provide adequate
documentation.

This directory contains the source for three programs: sunv,
suntohips, and hipstosun.  They are installed simply by typing 
"make install" having run the Configure program, as described in
README_INSTALL in the top-level HIPS-2 directory.

Sunv is an implementation of a suntool. It's function is to take a HIPS file
as input and display the first frame on the Sun console.  For binary images,
the image will be converted to most-significant-bit-first or
least-significant-bit-first as specified by MSBFVERSION/LSBFVERSION in the
configuration file, and so this should correspond to what your Sun hardware
requires (again, see README_INSTALL).  Sunv must be invoked from within
SunView. 

**********************

suntohips and hipstosun convert between HIPS-format images and
Sun-standard raster format images.  Only the first image of a sequence will be
converted.  Single-bit-depth images become bit-packed in HIPS, and
8-bit-depth images become byte-formatted in hips.  Usage is as follows:

		suntohips < Sun-image > HIPS-image
		hipstosun < HIPS-image > Sun-image

# HIPS
The HIPS Image Processing Software


     HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together  provide  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,  system  development  and  teaching. Originally  developed  at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing environments currently available.  It runs under  the  UNIX  operating  system.   It  is  modular   and flexible,  provides  automatic documentation of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.  It handles  sequences  of images (movies) in precisely the same manner as single frames.  Programs have been  developed  for simple   image   transformations,   filtering,  convolution, Fourier and other transform processing, edge  detection  and line  drawing  manipulation,  digital  image compression and transmission methods, noise generation, and image statistics computation.   Over  150  such image transformation programs have  been  developed.   As  a  result,  almost  any   image processing  task  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows users to  easily  integrate  their own  custom routines.  New users become effective using HIPS on their first day.

HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image  stored  in  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines which primarily deals
with a standardized  image  sequence  header,  and  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX "filters".  It comes complete with  source  code,  on-line manual  pages, and on-line documentation.  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for a variety of framestores and  windowing packages including X-windows.  It is a simple matter to interface HIPS with other framestores.   HIPS  can be  easily  adapted  for other image display devices because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.

HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an  interactive  research tool, and for more production-oriented tasks.  It is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and  extended  to  new  uses.   HIPS comes with source code,
libraries, a  library  of  convolution  masks,  and  on-line documentation and manual pages.

Features of the HIPS Image Processing Software:

*     Written in `C'
*     Runs on any Unix system
*     Drivers are available for a variety of displays
*     Conveniently adapted to other displays
*     Easy to learn, easy to use, easy to extend
*     Fourier,   Walsh,   and   dozens   of   other    image transformations
*     Over 150 transformations on pixels, frames, and movies (image sequences)
*     Unrestricted image size and sequence length
*     Stored images are self-documenting.  HIPS maintains  a complete  log  of  the  file history within the header file.  Every image file contains a record of who  owns it,  when  it  was  created,  file format as well as a record of all HIPS operations performed on it.
*     Operates on individual images or sequences  of  images (e.g.,  time  1,  time 2, ...; red, green, blue; left,
      right; slice 1, slice 2, ....)
*     Comes with source, a  complete  set  of  on-line  Unix manual pages, and detailed documentation.

HIPS programs perform:

*     Filtering, convolution, and edge detection
*     Image transform processing
*     Formatting and type conversio
*     Image compression methods
*     Image statistics
*     Image arithmetic
*     Image sequence manipulation
*     Single frame manipulation
*     Pixel value transformation (Point-transformation)
*     3D vector plotting
*     Noise generation
*     Device handling and halftoning
*     Image generation
*     Scaling and geometric transformation
*     Image header manipulation
*     Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids
*     User-contributed software

		HIPS News - Volume 5 - January 13, 2009

Well, I haven't sent out one of these since June, 1996! With a move from old
Sun boxes to PCs in my lab and no decent image viewers for the setup I had in
my office, I let HIPS atrophy for quite a number of years. But, now I've got a
nice OSX Mac on my desk and have managed to find enough time (and get a little
nudge and help) to get HIPS working again. There have been a number of minor
under-the-hood changes to get it to compile on current machines. In
particular, HIPS was written originally (some 27 years ago!) on a Berkeley
Unix Vax in straight Kernighan & Ritchie "C". At this point, most machines to
which I have access use gcc compilers (which are more finicky) and the
distribution of information in /usr/include has changed a bit as well. Also,
OSX uses stdarg instead of vararg for flexible argument lists. So, I've
attempted to modify things so that they work on new and older machines. But, I
don't have an older machine on which to test it, so I may well have broken
something! It compiles on a Mac (both leopard and tiger OSX) using the osx
configuration file with no compilation warnings. But, if you try it on other
machines and have any difficulties, or generate useful configuration files,
please share them with me (and the rest of the user base, should such a user
base still exist!).

Other important changes that just happened:

* The support for interaction between HIPS and Matlab was revised (the MEX
interface between C and Matlab had been changed since the early 90's when that
code was originally written).

* I modified the raw X11 HIPS image viewer to work on Macs. This new viewer is
in drivers/X/xhips and is called mhips. It shows still images and animates
frame sequences (movies).

* We also have a nice HIPS image and movie viewer for the Mac windowing system
(Cocoa), called hv. It isn't quite stable yet, but we hope to be able to
provide that relatively soon as well.

Here is the list of other changes I've made to HIPS since June 11, 1996.
Again, if you want an update to your copy of HIPS at any time, just
contact me.  Similarly, if you have any problems, or find bugs, or have
written something you'd like to share with other HIPS users, just let
me know.  Finally, if you want to set up a local distribution list
for this newsletter (i.e. hipsusers@machine), tell me what it is after
you set it up.

QUERY:  Lots of users (and potential users) have asked about HIPS under recent
versions of Solaris (2.4 and 2.5).  If anyone has already built HIPS under one
of these, I'd appreciate it if you'd share your experience (and working config
file) with us.  Similarly, there have been problems on SGI machines (e.g.
getting the manual pages installed sensibly automatically) and under LINUX.
So, please share your configuration files, bug fixes, etc.  Thanks.

6/23/98:	Added FLOAT to list of types handled by rotate (affects
		rotate.c, h_rotate.c, h_project.c)

1/20/00:	Deleted sys_errlist printing from xhips/xhipsc as they are not
		OS-independent.
		Modified hips_basic.h to avoid defining str*() if string.h
		was already included.

11/6/00:	Fixed calls to va_arg in lib/sources/xparam.c to treat byte
		and short arguments as int, since default promotion of
		arguments does that (Redhat Linux 7.0 flagged it).

3/29/01:	Fixed a few minor bugs in user-contributed/lbl/sources/hips/
			autocollage.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------

7/23/96	New version of user-contributed/lbl (Note:  it now potentially requires
	a patch to an X11 include file - see README_INSTALL).  Modified
	versions of config.osf1.template and a new config.solaris2.45.  They
	tested installation of HIPS on IRIX 5.3, OSF1/3.x, SOLARIS 2.4 and
	2.5, BSDI BSD/OS 2.x and FreeBSD 2.1 and 2.2.

9/9/96	Minor change (new error message) for
	user-contributed/cc/source/hupdown.c

1/9/97	Bug fix to h_sample.c (which effects program subsample) so that it
	works correctly for complex and double-complex images.  Thanks and a
	tip o' the hat to Mike Preston at Sheffield.

3/5/97	Minor changes to hips/sources/{histo.c,histoeq.c,histostretch.c,
	thresh.c,zc.c} to fix a bug (histo.histodealloc was never
	initialized).

4/4/97	Minor bug fixes to user-contributed/imsor/sources/{frarithmetic.c,
	util.h,raw2hips.c} to include math.h because of calls to atof.

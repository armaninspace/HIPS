		HIPS News - Volume 2

Here is the list of all changes I've made to HIPS since last December.
Again, if you want an update to your copy of HIPS at any time, just
contact me.  Similarly, if you have any problems, or find bugs, or have
written something you'd like to share with other HIPS users, just let
me know.  Finally, if you want to set up a local distribution list
for this newsletter (i.e. hipsusers@machine), tell me what it is after
you set it up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

12/93	H_BOOLEAN:  A minor change has happened recently to accomodate
	the new program `xdisp'.  It turns out that there is a conflict
	in the definition of Boolean between that used in HIPS and that
	included in some of the X-windows include files.  So, the
	current copy of HIPS has changed the HIPS type for Boolean
	variables to be called h_boolean.  This change affected huge
	numbers of files, and will affect your HIPS programs as well if
	you use the Boolean type (simply change all instances of
	Boolean to h_boolean to fix it).

	Affected files:  The definition is in sys/hips_basic.h and the
	word Boolean was changed to h_boolean everywhere else (affecting
	the majority of HIPS source files).

1/24/94	Minor bug fix to program shiftmin (in user-contributed/cc)

	Affected files:  user-contributed/cc/sources/shiftmin.c

2/11/94	Removed ifdef's around definition of h_boolean in hips_basic.h

	Affected files:  sys/hips_basic.h

2/24/94	Added routine `grepparam' to allow searches for header extended
	parameters using substring matching (from University of Sheffield's
	program xdisp)

	Affected files:  lib/sources/xparam.c,
	user-contributed/sheffield/xdisp/sources/hinter.c

2/24/94	Fixed a memory leak.  Added deallocation rights parameters to the
	memory header for orig_date, orig_name, seq_name.  This added two
	new routines (init_header_d and init_hdr_alloc_d) and slightly changed
	a few others.  Should not affect most users unless you are developing
	programs which keep multiple headers in memory and copy them around,
	allocate and deallocate them, etc. (e.g. user interface programs).

	Affected files:  sys/hips_header.h, lib/sources/{dup_header.c,
	fread_oldhdr.c,free_header.c,init_header.c,read_header.c}

2/24/94	Added a Solaris configuration file.  This involved adding a new
	configuration parameter (LDLIBFLAGS) for the call to ld used when
	libraries are made.

	Affected files:	config.* (including config.solaris.template),
	hips/libsrc/makefile.src, hipsaddon/main/libsrc/makefile.src,
	lib/sources/makefile.src, user-contributed/lbl/libscs/makefile.src,
	user-contributed/lbl/hips/libsrc/makefile.src,
	user-contributed/lbl/xview/guidexv/makefile.src,
	user-contributed/lbl/xview/libxcolor/makefile.src,
	user-contributed/lbl/rlelib/makefile.src,
	pub/libsrc/makefile.src

3/8/94	Added a new extended parameter `depth' which allows the user to define
	time sequences of 3D color images (column within row within color
	plane within depth plane within time step).  This should work
	transparently for current users (since depth defaults to one if
	undefined).  A new program (interdepth) was defined to merge images as
	different depth planes.  Other programs were modified to be able to
	handle or generate depth images (atop, genframe, genheader, subseq,
	intercolor, catframes, autodiff, strobe, repframe, calcpix, fcalcpix,
	calccomb, fcalccomb, calcwarp, comicstrip, interlace, and wrapimg).
	Many other programs will deal with depth images correctly with no
	modification (such as the image arithmetic programs:  addseq, mulseq,
	etc.).

	Affected files:  sys/{hips_basic.h,hips_error.h},
	lib/sources/{formatheader.c,herrs.c,read_hutils.c,maxformat.c,hdepth.c)
	hips/sources/{atop.c,genframe.c,genheader.c,subseq.c,intercolor.c,
		catframes.c,autodiff.c,strobe.c,repframe.c,calcpix.c,
		calcpixp.c,fcalcpix.c,fcalcpixp.c,interlace.c,calcwarp.c,
		calcwarpp.c,comicstrip.c,wrapimg.c,calccomb.c,calccombp.c,
		fcalccomb.c,fcalccombp.c,interdepth.c}

3/9/94	Added a subsampling program (subsample) and subroutines (h_sample).

	Affected files:  hips/libsrc/h_sample.c, hips/sources/subsample.c,
	and related makefile.src, man, libman and doc files.

3/14/94	Minor bug fixes to binatts and its manual page.

	Affected files:  hipsaddon/main/sources/binatts/binatts.c and
	associated manual page.

3/17/94	Fix to avoid yet another Solaris problem:  /usr/include/strings.h
	has disappeared.  I hard-coded the most popular function
	definitions in sys/hips_basic.h, and removed most references to
	string.h and strings.h (occasionally inserting references to
	hipl_format.h where they had been omitted).  I did not pull references
	to string.h/strings.h from user-contributed/lbl.

	Affected files:  sys/hips_basic.h, lib/sources/pa_*.c, various
	and sundry files in user-contributed.

4/7/94	Changed config.solaris to not use ranlib.  Changed
	hips/sources/makefile.src to make interdepth.

4/18/94	A new version of user-contributed/lbl was installed.  Also, the
	file sys/hips_basic.h was changed slightly: the definition of
	strlen() was removed as it conflicted with that assumed by gcc
	compilers.  The default of a returned integer is correct in most
	installations.

7/6/94	Minor fix to hips/sources/collage.c to fix a bug which only occured
	under Solaris.

7/14/94	Modified pshalftone to handle color, color maps, binary PostScript
	image formats, and other subtleties possible with PostScript Level 2.

7/21/94	New program added, scalemeansd, which scales a sequence so that each
	frame has a specified mean and standard deviation.

8/3/94	Minor changes to drivers/X/xhips/sources/{xhips.c,xhipsc.c}.

		HIPS News - Volume 4 - June 11, 1996

Here is the list of all changes I've made to HIPS since last November 2, 1994.
Again, if you want an update to your copy of HIPS at any time, just
contact me.  Similarly, if you have any problems, or find bugs, or have
written something you'd like to share with other HIPS users, just let
me know.  Finally, if you want to set up a local distribution list
for this newsletter (i.e. hipsusers@machine), tell me what it is after
you set it up.

QUERY:  Lots of users (and potential users) have asked about HIPS under recent
versions of Solaris (2.4 and 2.5).  If anyone has already built HIPS under one
of these, I'd appreciate it if you'd share your experience (and working config
file) with us.  Similarly, there have been problems on SGI machines (e.g.
getting the manual pages installed sensibly automatically) and under LINUX.
So, please share your configuration files, bug fixes, etc.  Thanks.

NEWS:  Morten Bro-Nielsen at the Technical University of Denmark has created a
wonderful tool, mvox,  for visualization of 2-, 3- and 4-dimensional images
that interfaces quite nicely with HIPS.  It is a commercial package, but
there is a free demonstration version that you can grab over the Web if you
are interested in checking it out.  I append below a short description of mvox.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1/9/95	Changed parseargs to use dynamic memory allocation to generate the
	usage message (so it doesn't crash with large lists of switches).
	Files affected: lib/sources/{pa_main.c,pa_parser.c,pa_usage.c}

1/17/95	Added config.solaris2.3 (from Claus Sternberg)

1/19/95	New version of user-contributed/imsor installed with lots of new
	programs.  README_INSTALL was edited to reflect problems compiling
	the imsor program called xshow (it needs lots of space in /tmp to
	compile successfully).

3/14/95	Added complex conjugate subroutines (h_conj) and main program
	(conjpix).

3/15/95	Did a whole slew of minor changes based on a very picky Silicon
	Graphics compiler's output.  Most are trivial (deleting unused
	variables).  Some were bug fixes.  Also, changed
	xvhips/xhips/xhipsc/xvanim to put the base of the filename in the
	titlebar.

4/13/95	Rewrote getmax/getmin from scratch adding lots of capabilities.  Moved
	them from user-contributed/cc to hips/sources.

4/18/95	Changed grating.c to default to 1 frame of output.

4/19/95	New programs pub/sources/{hipstoportable.c,portabletohips.c} for
	conversion to/from Jef Poskanzer's popular portable image formats 
	(PBM, PGM, PPM).

4/20/95	Bug fix to colorhips/sources/cscan.c so that it works on RGB (etc.)
	formats and not just on 3 separate color plane pixel formats.

4/25/95	Added Jef Poskanzer's Portable Bitmap code to HIPS
	(user-contributed/pbm), including the usual automatic installation
	stuff.

6/5/95	Added colormap support to the public domain HIPS header facilities
	(pub/libsrc/*.c).

8/29/95	Minor changes to run-length encoding stuff (rletob.c, hformatnames.c)

9/26/95	Minor changes to user-contributed/matlab/sources/readhips.c

11/17/95 Minor bug fix to lib/sources/read_histo.c (zero histodealloc flag)

1/12/96	Added full extended parameter and region-of-interest support to the
	public domain HIPS header facilities (pub/libsrc/*.c).

2/20/96	Configured/loaded HIPS using config.linux.template on a LINUX
	machine.  Made various minor code modifications to cut down on the
	number of warnings.  Unfortunately I have been unable to get
	user-contributed/{pbm,lbl} to compile under LINUX.  Also, my machine
	doesn't have X stuff loaded, so I didn't try to make any drivers.

--------------------------Description of Mvox-------------------------------

Mvox - Interactive 2-4D Image and Graphics Visualization Software

Mvox homepage: <http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~mvox/>

Mvox is a general purpose tool for visualization and manipulation of a
wide range of 2-4D grey level/colour images and 3D surface graphics.

Mvox can handle images with different depths, number of colours,
number of time instances and has been successfully used in the past
to visualize 3D medical images with stacks of slices (CT, MRI, etc.),
2D remote sensing images with many channels and 2D colour images
(Red, Green and Blue). In addition Mvox can also display and manipulate
3D surface graphics (as used in CAD programs). 3D graphics can be
exported in VRML format for use on WWW.

The wide range of data types that can be handled by Mvox makes it a
very flexible tool and it is especially well suited for users with
changing or widespread needs.

Keywords: *Image browser, *Fast slicing, *Volume rendering using the
    VolPack library, *Iso-surface rendering (result similar to Marching
    Cubes), *3D surface graphics, *Interactive thresholding, *Drawing,
    *Statistical classification using discriminant analysis, *Histogram,
    *Statistics, *Histogram stretch, *Enlarge, *Colormaps, *Contours,
    *3D shape from contours using Nuages, *Overview window, *Advanced
    command line interface, *User-defined functions

Image formats: *ANALYZE, *TIFF, *SGI, *TGA, *BMP, *Inrimage, *HIPS, *BRIMG.

3D formats: Import: *OFF, *Flex3D - Export: *VRML, *DXF, *Inventor, *Flex3D

Mvox is only supported on Silicon Graphics platforms, but can run on
some HP, IBM RS/6000 and DEC-Alpha as well. A free demo version and test
images are available from the Mvox homepage:

		<http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~mvox/>

The demo version will only work with the test images. Licenses are available
for approximately $2,500 (DKK 15,000 excl. VAT).
